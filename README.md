#### Notes from Lift CookBook by David Pollak
* The Boot class is run when starting your application, and itâ€™s where you can configure the behaviour of Lift.
* ```xsbt-web-plugin``` plugin will allow you to start and stop your application.
* The web.xml file tells web containers, such as Jetty as configured by xsbt-web-plugin, to pass all requests on to Lift.
